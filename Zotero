	abstract = {Myxococcus xanthus has a lifecycle characterized by several social interactions. In the presence of prey, M. xanthus is a predator forming cooperatively feeding colonies, and in the absence of nutrients, M. xanthus cells interact to form multicellular, spore-filled fruiting bodies. Formation of both cellular patterns depends on extracellular functions including the extracellular matrix and intercellular signals. Interestingly, the formation of these patterns also depends on several activities that involve direct cell–cell contacts between M. xanthus cells or direct contacts between M. xanthus cells and the substratum, suggesting that M. xanthus cells have a marked ability to distinguish self from nonself. Genome-wide analyses of the M. xanthus genome reveal a large potential for protein secretion. Myxococcus xanthus harbours all protein secretion systems required for translocation of unfolded and folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane and an intact type II secretion system. Moreover, M. xanthus contains 60 ATP-binding cassette transporters, two degenerate type III secretion systems, both of which lack the parts in the outer membrane and the needle structure, and an intact type VI secretion system for one-step translocation of proteins across the cell envelope. Also, analyses of the M. xanthus proteome reveal a large protein secretion potential including many proteins of unknown function.},

	abstract = {The surface layers (S layers) of those bacteria and archaea that elaborate these crystalline structures have been studied for 40 years. However, most structural analysis has been based on electron microscopy of negatively stained S-layer fragments separated from cells, which can introduce staining artifacts and allow rearrangement of structures prone to self-assemble. We present a quantitative analysis of the structure and organization of the S layer on intact growing cells of the Gram-negative bacterium Caulobacter crescentus using cryo-electron tomography (CET) and statistical image processing. Instead of the expected long-range order, we observed different regions with hexagonally organized subunits exhibiting short-range order and a broad distribution of periodicities. Also, areas of stacked double layers were found, and these increased in extent when the S-layer protein (RsaA) expression level was elevated by addition of multiple rsaA copies. Finally, we combined high-resolution amino acid residue-specific Nanogold labeling and subtomogram averaging of CET volumes to improve our understanding of the correlation between the linear protein sequence and the structure at the 2-nm level of resolution that is presently available. The results support the view that the U-shaped RsaA monomer predicted from negative-stain tomography proceeds from the N terminus at one vertex, corresponding to the axis of 3-fold symmetry, to the C terminus at the opposite vertex, which forms the prominent 6-fold symmetry axis. Such information will help future efforts to analyze subunit interactions and guide selection of internal sites for display of heterologous protein segments.},

	abstract = {Electron microscopy of isolated cell walls of the ancient bacterium Thermus thermophilus revealed that most of the peptidoglycan (PG) surface, apart from the septal region, was shielded against specific alphaPG antibodies. On the other hand, an antiserum raised against S-layer-attached cell wall fragments (alphaSAC) bound to most of the surface except for the septal regions. Treatments with alpha-amylase and pronase E made the entire cell wall surface uniformly accessible to alphaPG and severely decreased the binding of alphaSAC. We concluded that a layer of strongly bound secondary cell wall polymers (SCWPs) covers most of the cell wall surface in this ancient bacterium. A preliminary analysis revealed that such SCWPs constitute 14\% of the cell wall and are essentially composed of sugars. Enzyme treatments of the cell walls revealed that SCWP was required in vitro for the binding of the S-layer protein through the S-layer homology (SLH) motif. The csaB gene was necessary for the attachment of the S-layer-outer membrane (OM) complex to the cell wall in growing cells of T. thermophilus. In vitro experiments confirmed that cell walls from a csaB mutant bound to the S-layer with a much lower affinity ( approximately 1/10) than that of the wild type. CsaB was found to be required for pyruvylation of components of the SCWP and for immunodetection with alpha-SAC antiserum. Therefore, the S-layer-OM complex of T. thermophilus binds to the cell wall through the SLH motif of the S-layer protein via a strong interaction with a highly immunogenic pyruvylated component of the SCWP. Immuno-cross-reactive compounds were detected with alphaSAC on cell walls of other Thermus spp. and in the phylogenetically related microorganism Deinococcus radiodurans. These results imply that the interaction between the SLH motif and pyruvylated components of the cell wall arose early during bacterial evolution as an ancestral mechanism for anchoring proteins and outer membranes to the cell walls of primitive bacteria.},

Each bacterial community was exposed to four different γ radiation doses ranging from 0.46 to 3.96 kGy to test whether chronic exposure to radiation had selected for resistant bacterial strains. Experimental radiation duration had an increasingly overall negative effect on the survival of all bacterial communities. After exposure to γ radiation, bacteria isolated from the site with intermediate background radiation levels survived better and produced more colonies than the bacterial communities from other study sites with higher or lower background radiation levels. Long-term effects of radiation in natural populations might be an important selective pressure on traits of bacteria that facilitate survival in certain environments.

This bacterium is surrounded by a surface layer (S-layer) built of a regular repetition of several proteins, assembled to form a paracrystalline structure. Here we report that the deletion of a main constituent of this S-layer, the gene DR\_2577, causes a decrease in the UVC resistance, especially in desiccated cells. Moreover, we show that the DR\_2577 protein binds the carotenoid deinoxanthin, a strong protective antioxidant specific of this bacterium. A further spectroscopical characterization of the deinoxanthin-DR\_2577 complex revealed features which could suggest a protective role of DR\_2577. We propose that, especially under desiccation, the S-layer shields the bacterium from incident ultraviolet light and could behave as a first lane of defense against UV radiation.},

By virtue of its quite unusual resistance to chemical perturbants it can easily be isolated, e.g. by detergent extraction of whole cells. A detailed description of the morphology of the HPI layer protein is given (resolution 1.8 nm), based on electron microscopy and image processing. Infrared spectroscopy shows that the secondary structure of the protein is stable under a wide range of environmental conditions; a considerable portion (30\%) of the protein exists in the form of j structure. Direct mass measurements in a scanning transmission electron microscope reveal that the HPI layer protein has a molecular mass of approximately 655 kDa. Although masked by extensive proteolytic cleavage it appears that the morphologicaI protein units are composed of six identical protomers. All evidence accumulated so far supports our view that proteolysis is not a preparation artifact, but occurs already in vivo, without affecting the physical structure of the protein.},

Gld proteins are thought to comprise the motor that propels the cell surface adhesin SprB. Cells with mutations in sprB are partially defective in motility and are also resistant to some bacteriophages. Transposon mutagenesis of a strain carrying a deletion spanning sprB identified eight mutants that were resistant to additional phages and exhibited reduced motility. Four of the mutants had transposon insertions in remA, which encodes a cell surface protein that has a lectin domain and appears to interact with polysaccharides. Three other genes identified in this screen (remC, wza, and wzc) encode proteins predicted to be involved in polysaccharide synthesis and secretion. Myc-tagged versions of RemA localized to the cell surface and were propelled rapidly along the cell at speeds of 1 to 2 μm/s. Deletion of gldN and gldO, which encode components of a bacteroidete protein secretion system, blocked the transport of RemA to the cell surface. Overexpression of RemA resulted in the formation of cell aggregates that were dispersed by the addition of galactose or rhamnose. Cells lacking RemC, Wza, and Wzc failed to aggregate. Cells of a remC mutant and cells of a remA mutant, neither of which formed aggregates in isolation, aggregated when they were mixed together, suggesting that polysaccharides secreted by one cell may interact with RemA on another cell. Fluorescently labeled lectin Ricinus communis agglutinin I detected polysaccharides secreted by F. johnsoniae. The polysaccharides bound to cells expressing RemA and were rapidly propelled on the cell surface. RemA appears to be a mobile cell surface adhesin, and secreted polysaccharides may interact with the lectin domain of RemA and enhance motility.},

	abstract = {Flavobacterium johnsoniae exhibits rapid gliding motility over surfaces. At least 20 genes are involved in this process. Seven of these, gldK, gldL, gldM, gldN, sprA, sprE, and sprT, encode proteins of the type IX protein secretion system (T9SS). The T9SS is required for surface localization of the motility adhesins SprB and RemA, and for secretion of the soluble chitinase ChiA. Here, we demonstrate that the gliding motility proteins GldA, GldB, GldD, GldF, GldH, GldI, and GldJ are also essential for secretion. Cells with mutations in the genes encoding any of these seven proteins had normal levels of gldK mRNA but dramatically reduced levels of the GldK protein, which may explain the secretion defects of the motility mutants. GldJ is necessary for stable accumulation of GldK, and each mutant lacked the GldJ protein. F. johnsoniae cells that produced truncated GldJ, lacking eight to 13 amino acids from the C terminus, accumulated GldK but were deficient in gliding motility. SprB was secreted by these cells but was not propelled along their surfaces. This C-terminal region of GldJ is thus required for gliding motility but not for secretion. The identification of mutants that are defective for motility but competent for secretion begins to untangle the F. johnsoniae gliding motility machinery from the T9SS.IMPORTANCE Many members of the phylum Bacteroidetes secrete proteins using T9SSs. T9SSs appear to be confined to members of this phylum. Many of these bacteria also glide rapidly over surfaces using a motility machine that is also confined to the Bacteroidetes and appears to be intertwined with the T9SS. This study identifies F. johnsoniae proteins that are required for both T9SS function and gliding motility. It also provides an explanation for the link between secretion and gliding and identifies mutants with defects in motility but not secretion.},

Gliding bacteria move actively over surfaces by a process that does not involve flagella. Gliding bacteria are phylogenetically diverse and are abundant in many environments. Recent results indicate that more than one mechanism is needed to explain all forms of bacterial gliding motility. Myxococcus xanthus “social gliding motility” and Synechocystis gliding are similar to bacterial “twitching motility” and rely on type IV pilus extension and retraction for cell movement. In contrast, gliding of filamentous cyanobacteria, mycoplasmas, members of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium group, and “adventurous gliding” of M. xanthus do not appear to involve pili. The mechanisms of movement employed by these bacteria are still a matter of speculation. Genetic, biochemical, ultrastructural, and behavioral studies are providing insight into the machineries employed by these diverse bacteria that enable them to glide over surfaces.},

Its intercalation within core-units stimulates array formation, whereas its N-terminal interaction domain enables polar recruitment of arrays and facilitates its own polar localization. Linkage of these domains within ParP couples array formation and localization and results in controlled array positioning at the cell pole. Notably, ParP's integration into arrays modifies its own and ParC's subcellular localization dynamics, promoting their polar retention. ParP serves as a critical nexus that regulates the localization dynamics of its network constituents and drives the localized assembly and stability of the chemotactic machinery, resulting in proper cell pole development.},

They are helical fibres of pilin proteins assembled by a multi-component macromolecular machine we call the basal body. Based on pilin features, T4P are classified into type IVa pili (T4aP) and type IVb pili (T4bP) 1,2. T4aP are more widespread and are involved in cell motility 3, DNA transfer 4, host predation 5 and electron transfer 6. T4bP are less prevalent and are mainly found in enteropathogenic bacteria, where they play key roles in host colonization 7. Following similar work on T4aP machines 8,9, here we use electron cryotomography 10 to reveal the three-dimensional in situ structure of a T4bP machine in its piliated and non-piliated states. The specific machine we analyse is the Vibrio cholerae toxin-coregulated pilus machine (TCPM). Although only about half of the components of the TCPM show sequence homology to components of the previously analysed Myxococcus xanthus T4aP machine (T4aPM), we find that their structures are nevertheless remarkably similar. Based on homologies with components of the M. xanthus T4aPM and additional reconstructions of TCPM mutants in which the non-homologous proteins are individually deleted, we propose locations for all eight TCPM components within the complex. Non-homologous proteins in the T4aPM and TCPM are found to form similar structures, suggesting new hypotheses for their functions and evolutionary histories.},

Vibrio cholerae contains three chemotaxis clusters (I, II, and III). Here, using electron cryotomography, we explore V. cholerae's cytoplasmic chemoreceptor array and establish that it is formed by proteins from cluster I. We further identify a chemoreceptor with an unusual domain architecture, DosM, which is essential for formation of the cytoplasmic arrays. DosM contains two signaling domains and spans the two-layered cytoplasmic arrays.

Better automation has enabled researchers to prepare and run more experiments in a shorter time. However, the problem of identifying which experiments are successful remains difficult. In fact, most of this work is still performed manually by humans. Automating this task is therefore an important goal. As part of a project to develop a new and automated high-throughput capillary-based protein crystallography instrument, a new image-classification subsystem has been developed to greatly reduce the number of images that require human viewing. This system must have low rates of false negatives (missed crystals), possibly at the cost of raising the number of false positives. The image-classification system employs a support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm to classify the blocks making up each image. A new algorithm to find the area within the image that contains the drop is employed. The SVM uses numerical features, based on texture and the Gabor wavelet decomposition, that are calculated for each block. If a block within an image is classified as containing a crystal, then the entire image is classified as containing a crystal. In a study of 375 images, 87 of which contained crystals, a false-negative rate of less than 4\% with a false-positive rate of about 40\% was consistently achieved.},

The current paper is a survey of HT and its variants, their limitations and the modifications made to overcome them, the implementation issues in software and hardware, and applications in various fields. Our survey, along with more than 200 references, will help the researchers and students to get a comprehensive view on HT and guide them in applying it properly to their problems of interest.},

	abstract = {An algorithm for automatic classification of protein crystallization images acquired from a high-throughput vapor-diffusion system is described. The classifier uses edge detection followed by dynamic-programming curve tracking to determine the drop boundary; this technique optimizes a scoring function that incorporates roundness, smoothness and gradient intensity. The classifier focuses on the most promising region in the drop and computes a number of statistical features, including some derived from the Hough transform and from curve tracking. The five classes of images are `Empty', `Clear', `Precipitate', `Microcrystal Hit' and `Crystal'. On test data, the classifier gives about 12\% false negatives (true crystals called `Empty', `Clear' or `Precipitate') and about 14\% false positives (true clears or precipitates called `Crystal' or `Microcrystal Hit').},
